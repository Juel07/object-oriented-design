### Domain modelling exercise - Library

#### Task
- Have a go at writing the code and manually testing the library/book example
- Have a go at writing tests in RSpec. If you want to focus on TDD, you can delete the code and test drive the program
- Have a go at isolating your tests between book and library

What would a domain diagram for these user stories look like?
