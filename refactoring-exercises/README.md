### Refactoring Exercises

#### Learn to

- Improving the Design of existing code.

## Introduction

> Refactoring is a controlled technique for improving the design of an existing code base. Its essence is applying a series of small behavior-preserving transformations, each of which "too small to be worth doing". However the cumulative effect of each of these transformations is quite significant. â€“ Martin Fowler

**Refactoring** is the third and final part of the Red, Green, Refactor TDD Cycle. It's also the most important part. From doing refactoring, you:

- Improve the design of your code
- Learn more about the whole program you're designing
- Define the patterns and names that make your code extensible.

In this practical, you will learn three simple techniques for refactoring, and when to use them:

- Extract variable for unnamed expressions
- Extract method for unnamed procedures
- Extract class for unnamed objects
